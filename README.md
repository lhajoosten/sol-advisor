# Sol Advisor

**Sol runs the show. Luna handles routine implementation, Terra takes the harder
builds, and a fresh Sol review with a requested read-only profile stands between the
diff and done.**

Sol Advisor is a Codex-native architect workflow for capability-routed software
delivery. The primary session stays focused on requirements, architecture, specs, and
verification while native Codex custom-agent threads handle implementation and review.

| Lane | Native agent type | Pinned profile | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | Primary session | GPT-5.6 Sol / High | Requirements, architecture, decomposition, routing, and acceptance |
| Routine implementation | sol_advisor_luna_implementer | GPT-5.6 Luna / Max | Mechanical, repeatable, fully specified work |
| Harder implementation | sol_advisor_terra_implementer | GPT-5.6 Terra / Max | Context-heavy, higher-risk, or wider-blast-radius work |
| Final review | sol_advisor_sol_reviewer | GPT-5.6 Sol / High / requests read-only | Fresh review of the actual diff and verification evidence |

The final review is context-independent, not model-family-independent: Sol reviews
Sol's orchestration with a fresh context. That catches conversational assumptions, but
it is not cross-vendor review.

## Install from GitHub

Requirements:

- A current Codex CLI or ChatGPT desktop app with plugins, native subagents, and
  custom agents enabled.
- Access to GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna at the required reasoning levels.
- jq, which the companion-install lookup uses to locate the installed plugin package.

Add the GitHub repository as a Codex marketplace, then install the plugin:

~~~sh
codex plugin marketplace add DannyMac180/sol-advisor --ref main
codex plugin add sol-advisor@sol-advisor
~~~

### Install the companion custom agents

Plugin installation does **not** automatically install custom-agent files. That is
intentional: the files are user-owned role pins, and the installer must never overwrite
a different local role silently. Install the companion templates separately:

~~~sh
plugin_dir="$(codex plugin list --json | jq -r '.installed[] | select(.pluginId == "sol-advisor@sol-advisor") | .source.path')"
test -n "$plugin_dir"
test -d "$plugin_dir"
sh "$plugin_dir/scripts/install-agents.sh"
sh "$plugin_dir/scripts/install-agents.sh" --check
~~~

Without an explicit target, the installer uses the existing CODEX_HOME value when one is
already set, otherwise the user's default Codex agents directory. It does not invoke
Codex, edit config.toml, or overwrite a differing agent file. It only installs a
missing template and then verifies every installed copy byte-for-byte.

Start a **new Codex task** after the check passes. Native agent types are discovered at
task creation, so an existing task may not see the installed roles.

Then select GPT-5.6 Sol with High reasoning for the primary session and ask for
implementation work normally, or invoke the orchestration skill explicitly:

~~~text
Use $sol-advisor:orchestration to build this feature, verify it, and obtain the final Sol review before reporting done.
~~~

## Check and update

Run this check whenever a route must be trusted:

~~~sh
plugin_dir="$(codex plugin list --json | jq -r '.installed[] | select(.pluginId == "sol-advisor@sol-advisor") | .source.path')"
test -d "$plugin_dir"
sh "$plugin_dir/scripts/install-agents.sh" --check
~~~

To update the marketplace plugin and then re-check its companion roles:

~~~sh
codex plugin marketplace upgrade sol-advisor
codex plugin add sol-advisor@sol-advisor
plugin_dir="$(codex plugin list --json | jq -r '.installed[] | select(.pluginId == "sol-advisor@sol-advisor") | .source.path')"
test -d "$plugin_dir"
sh "$plugin_dir/scripts/install-agents.sh" --check
~~~

If the new shipped template differs from an installed role, the check and installer
fail rather than overwriting it. Inspect and deliberately reconcile the reported
destination with the shipped template, then rerun the check. Do not use a substitute
agent as a shortcut. Start a fresh task after every successful install or update.

## Runtime routing evidence

Native spawn/details metadata is the primary source of routing evidence. It must show
the selected custom agent type. When it also exposes model and effort, the orchestrator
compares those values with the role pin. If Desktop omits model or effort and the local
rollout is accessible, use the companion inspector as the authoritative read-only
fallback for those omitted fields:

~~~sh
plugin_dir="$(codex plugin list --json | jq -r '.installed[] | select(.pluginId == "sol-advisor@sol-advisor") | .source.path')"
thread_id="<native-subagent-thread-id>"
sh "$plugin_dir/scripts/inspect-agent-runtime.sh" "$thread_id"
~~~

For a disposable fixture or a non-default local session root, pass it explicitly:

~~~sh
sh "$plugin_dir/scripts/inspect-agent-runtime.sh" --sessions-dir /absolute/path/to/sessions "$thread_id"
~~~

The helper searches only rollout filenames ending in that exact thread id, then emits a
single compact JSON object with allowlisted routing fields. It never prints prompts,
messages, environment variables, tokens, configuration contents, or arbitrary rollout
payloads. It refuses invalid ids, zero or multiple matches, and missing or inconsistent
role/model/effort; there is no inferred fallback. If public and local evidence both
exist, they must agree.

## How routing works

The Sol orchestrator writes a five-part spec for every implementation: objective, file
ownership, interfaces, constraints, and verification. Luna is the default producer.
Terra is selected when judgment, context, or blast radius is materially higher, or
when one Luna attempt demonstrates that the task was misclassified.

Before delegation and acceptance, the skill requires all of the following:

1. The installed role files pass the byte-for-byte companion check.
2. The native spawn tool exposes all three exact names in the table above.
3. Public native spawn/details metadata identifies the selected role and, when exposed,
   its expected model and effort. If model or effort is omitted, the exact-rollout local
   inspector above must provide them instead.
4. The reviewer’s observed sandbox policy type and permission profile type are captured
   and reported.

A missing, stale, conflicting, unavailable, inconsistent, or unobservable
role/model/effort stops the affected lane with an actionable error. There is no silent
model, reasoning, or agent-type fallback, and per-spawn calls do not override the role
pins.

The Sol reviewer TOML requests read-only sandboxing, but the host permission profile
may broaden that request. If the observed sandbox policy type is read-only, review can
proceed with enforced isolation. If the host broadens it, review can proceed only as
behaviorally read-only when hard isolation is not required, the prompt forbids edits,
and the parent captures and verifies exact before-and-after repository/artifact state;
the broader sandbox and permission profile must be reported as residual risk. If hard
isolation is required, the sandbox cannot be observed, or any mutation occurs, stop the
review lane and do not claim enforced read-only isolation.

The orchestrator inspects every diff and reruns verification. A fresh Sol reviewer then
returns ship, fix-first, or rethink. The session cannot report completion until the
reviewer returns ship. These remain native Codex subagent threads; Sol Advisor does not
launch a nested Codex CLI process or globally reroute unrelated subagents.

## Local development

This fork is intended to live at `/home/lhajoosten/projects/sol-advisor` and to be
installed as a local Codex marketplace. Keep the upstream repository configured as a
fetch-only remote; review upstream changes locally and never push this fork unless the
owner explicitly adds a push destination.

Version 0.3.0 adds a repository-first fullstack contract to all three roles. Workers
read repository instructions, use existing Taskfile tasks, develop on Python 3.13 with
uv, Ruff, and ty only, preserve backend/frontend architecture boundaries, and do not
hand-edit generated API clients. They run targeted checks during implementation and
reserve broad suites for explicit final gates. The reviewer requires the corresponding
Taskfile evidence and rejects prohibited Python tooling or generated-client drift.

Install a checkout as a local marketplace when you want Codex to use its skill:

~~~sh
cd /absolute/path/to/sol-advisor
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/sol-advisor
codex plugin add sol-advisor@sol-advisor
~~~

Run the repository verifier separately. It uses only a disposable target directory and
never changes your Codex configuration:

~~~sh
cd /absolute/path/to/sol-advisor
sh plugins/sol-advisor/scripts/verify.sh
git diff --check
~~~

To exercise the installer itself against an explicit disposable target:

~~~sh
cd /absolute/path/to/sol-advisor
scratch_agents="$(mktemp -d)"
sh plugins/sol-advisor/scripts/install-agents.sh --target-dir "$scratch_agents"
sh plugins/sol-advisor/scripts/install-agents.sh --target-dir "$scratch_agents" --check
~~~

To install this checkout's templates for real local development, use the same
repository-relative commands without --target-dir, then begin a new task:

~~~sh
cd /absolute/path/to/sol-advisor
sh plugins/sol-advisor/scripts/install-agents.sh
sh plugins/sol-advisor/scripts/install-agents.sh --check
~~~

After editing the plugin, validate both layers:

~~~sh
cd /absolute/path/to/sol-advisor
if [ -n "$CODEX_HOME" ]; then
  codex_skills="$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system"
else
  codex_skills="$HOME/.codex/skills/.system"
fi
uv run --no-project --with pyyaml python "$codex_skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py" plugins/sol-advisor/skills/orchestration
uv run --no-project --with pyyaml python "$codex_skills/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py" plugins/sol-advisor
jq empty .agents/plugins/marketplace.json plugins/sol-advisor/.codex-plugin/plugin.json
~~~

The verifier validates JSON and TOML, role pins, installer clean/idempotent/check and
conflict behavior, runtime-inspector safe fixtures, contract references, and shell
syntax. The uv commands supply the validators' PyYAML dependency in a disposable
environment. They do not install the marketplace or mutate Codex configuration.
